# UGA Virtual Reality 2025 – Portfolio – Demo 1: Solar System Simulation 🪐

## Description
This project was created for the **University of Georgia Virtual Reality course** as part of my VR class portfolio.  
It demonstrates foundational **3D transformations**, **object hierarchies**, and **lighting** by building a simple solar system model featuring the **Sun**, **Earth**, and **Moon** with orbital motion and realistic rotations.

## Core Features 🌍✨
1. **Orbital system:** The **Earth orbits the Sun** and the **Moon orbits the Earth**.  

2. **Seasonal tilt:** The Earth is tilted approximately **23.5°** to illustrate seasonal changes.  

3. **Lighting setup:** The **Sun acts as the main light source**, showing day/night cycles and moon phases.  

4. **Distinct visuals:** **Materials** and **sizes** help differentiate planets — **yellow** Sun, **green** Earth, and **grey** Moon.
